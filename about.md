BitLancaster is a community for those interested in discussing and participating in
the research and development of Bitcoin and related protocols. You can be well
versed with or new to the topics, all are welcome. Be advised: discussion can
get technical.

### Socratic Seminars

Our monthly Socratic Seminar events are formatted to foster debate, information
sharing and lively discussion. In the weeks preceding the event, discussion
topics are collated by meetup members from a variety of sources: news outlets, research papers, technical blog posts,
repos, podcasts and more. After a period of discussion, some events will have [presentations](https://bitdevs.org/presenter-guidelines/). These presentations can range from open source
projects, companies, and research to general bitcoin education. A feedback and Q&A
section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby restaurant to
socialize.

A newsletter is sent out the day of the event which outlines discussion topics.
Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event
descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event is NEVER
recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin
in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.

Please contact the organizers if you'd like to present at a future Socratic
event or have a recommended topic for discussion: jbrauck417@gmail. There
are different requirements for presentations depending on the nature of the
project.

### Bitcoin Basics Series

Twice a year we will put out longer form educational presentation content. These sessions are designed for newcomers and those seeking to strengthen their foundational knowledge. Topics typically include:

- Bitcoin's core technology and how it works
- Wallets, keys, and best practices for security
- The economics of Bitcoin and monetary theory
- Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network
- Practical skills such as setting up wallets and making transactions
- (Lightly) Mining, nodes, and network infrastructure

Each session includes Q&A time and hands-on demonstrations where appropriate.

### A Bitcoiners Life Series

Our lifestyle series explores the cultural and philosophical aspects that often accompany Bitcoin adoption. These sessions delve into topics commonly discussed in Bitcoiner circles including:

- Nutritional sovereignty (carnivore diet, avoiding seed oils)
- Food independence through local and bulk meat sourcing
- Water quality and filtration methods
- Personal sovereignty and libertarian principles
- Self-defense and second amendment rights
- Resilience through practical skill development
- Building community with like-minded individuals

These informal discussions provide practical insights for those looking to align their lifestyle with the self-sovereign values that Bitcoin represents.
